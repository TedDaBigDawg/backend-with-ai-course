# Mini Project 1 — Simple REST API

**Due:** End of Week 04  
**Weight:** 10%

## Brief

Build a complete REST API using NestJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The API should implement full CRUD operations for a resource of your choice (e.g., Tasks, Products, Posts, Books).

## Requirements

- NestJS application with proper structure (controllers, services, modules)
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- At least one resource/entity with multiple fields
- Proper error handling
- RESTful endpoint design
- Tested with Postman or similar tool

## Deliverables

- GitHub repository link with source code
- README with:
  - Project description
  - Setup instructions
  - API endpoint documentation
  - How to run locally
- Postman collection or API documentation (optional but recommended)

## Rubric (10 points)

- **NestJS Structure (2):** Proper use of controllers, services, modules
- **Database & Prisma (2):** Schema designed, migrations run, Prisma integrated
- **CRUD Operations (3):** All CRUD operations working correctly
- **Error Handling (1):** Basic error handling implemented
- **Code Quality (1):** Code is organized, readable, follows best practices
- **Documentation (1):** README complete, setup instructions clear

## Starter

- You may start from `templates/project-scaffold/` or create a new NestJS project
- Use the setup guide from Week 01-03 sessions

## AI-Assisted Learning

- Use AI to generate starter code structure
- Ask AI to explain NestJS concepts you don't understand
- Use AI to debug errors you encounter
- Have AI review your code and suggest improvements

**Remember:** AI is a learning tool. Understand the code you write!
