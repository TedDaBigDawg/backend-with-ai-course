# Mini Project 2 — Authentication-enabled API

**Due:** End of Week 07  
**Weight:** 15%

## Brief

Extend your Mini Project 1 (or create a new API) to include authentication and authorization. Implement user registration, login with JWT, and protect routes with authentication guards.

## Requirements

- User registration endpoint (signup)
- User login endpoint with JWT token generation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Authentication guards protecting routes
- At least one protected endpoint
- Role-based access control (optional but recommended)
- Proper error handling for authentication

## Deliverables

- GitHub repository link with source code
- README with:
  - Project description
  - Setup instructions
  - Authentication flow documentation
  - API endpoint documentation
  - How to test authentication
- Postman collection with authentication examples

## Rubric (15 points)

- **Authentication (4):** Signup and login working, passwords hashed
- **JWT Implementation (3):** JWT tokens generated and validated
- **Guards & Protection (3):** Routes protected with guards
- **Error Handling (2):** Proper error handling for auth scenarios
- **Code Quality (2):** Code well-organized, follows best practices
- **Documentation (1):** README complete, auth flow documented

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Mini Project 1 or equivalent CRUD API
- Understanding of JWT and authentication concepts from Week 06-07

## AI-Assisted Learning

- Use AI to generate authentication boilerplate
- Ask AI to explain JWT flow and security concepts
- Use AI to debug authentication issues
- Have AI review your security implementation

## Submission

- Update your PR or create a new one: "MP2: Your Name — Project Title"
- Include repository link and authentication features implemented
