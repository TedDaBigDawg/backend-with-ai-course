### Optional but Recommended
- File upload functionality
- External API integration
- Pagination and filtering
- Environment configuration
- Deployment to production platform

## Project Ideas

Choose one of these or propose your own:

1. **Task Management API:** Users, tasks, projects, teams
2. **E-commerce Backend:** Products, orders, customers, cart
3. **Blog Platform API:** Posts, comments, users, categories
4. **Social Media API:** Posts, users, likes, follows, comments
5. **Learning Management System:** Courses, students, instructors, assignments

## Deliverables

1. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Complete source code
   - Well-organized structure
   - README with setup instructions
   - Clear commit history

2. **README Documentation:**
   - Project description and purpose
   - Features list
   - Setup instructions
   - API documentation link
   - Technology stack
   - Future improvements

3. **API Documentation:**
   - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - All endpoints documented
   - Examples provided
   - Authentication guide

4. **Presentation (Week 14):**
   - 5-10 minute presentation
   - Live demo of API
   - Showcase key features
   - Discuss challenges and learning

5. **Reflection (Optional):**
   - What you learned
   - Challenges overcome
   - How AI assisted your learning
   - Future improvements

## Rubric (25 points)

- **Documentation (4):** Complete README, Swagger docs, clear instructions
- **Architecture (4):** Proper NestJS structure, organized modules, separation of concerns
- **Testing (2):** Tested with Postman, endpoints working correctly
- **Presentation (2):** Clear presentation, demonstrates understanding

## Proposal Submission

Submit your project proposal at the start of Week 13:

- Project title and description
- Features you plan to implement
- Resources/entities you'll create
- Technology stack
- Timeline for completion

## AI-Assisted Learning

- Use AI to brainstorm project ideas
- Ask AI to help scaffold your project structure
- Use AI to review your code and suggest improvements
- Ask AI to help with documentation
- Use AI to debug issues throughout development

**Remember:** AI is a learning partner. Use it to understand concepts and generate starter code, but ensure you understand everything you implement!

## Submission

- Final code submission: End of Week 14
- Presentation: Week 14, Session 14
- Update your PR: "Final Project: Your Name — Project Title"

## Tips

- Start early and plan your project
- Break it into smaller tasks
- Test as you build
- Use AI to help, but understand the code
- Focus on code quality, not just features
- Document as you go
- Prepare your presentation well

Good luck! 🚀
