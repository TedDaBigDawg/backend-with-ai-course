## Deliverables This Week

- Complete Session 07 lab: Implement guards and protect your API endpoints
- **Mini Project 2 Due:** Authentication-enabled API with protected routes
- Homework: Add role-based access to different endpoints
- Optional: Implement user profile endpoint that requires authentication

## AI-Assisted Learning

- Ask AI to explain the difference between authentication and authorization
- Use AI to generate guard examples and explain how they work
- Prompt AI to suggest security improvements for your API
- Ask AI to help design role-based access patterns
