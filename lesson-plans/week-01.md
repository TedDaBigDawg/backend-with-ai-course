## Deliverables This Week

- Complete Session 01 lab: Build a simple "Hello World" API with multiple routes
- Homework: Create a basic NestJS app with 3-5 endpoints that return JSON data
- Optional: Deploy your API locally and test with Postman

## AI-Assisted Learning

- Ask AI to explain the client-server model using analogies (restaurant, mail service)
- Prompt AI to generate NestJS boilerplate code and break it down line by line
- Use AI to quiz yourself on HTTP methods and status codes
- Ask AI to explain any errors you encounter during setup
