## AI as Your Learning Partner

Throughout this course, you'll use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot) to:
- Explain backend concepts you find confusing
- Generate starter code that you then understand and modify
- Debug errors and understand what went wrong
- Review your code and suggest improvements
- Generate documentation and comments

Remember: AI is a tool to help you learn backend development. Focus on understanding the concepts, not just copying code.
