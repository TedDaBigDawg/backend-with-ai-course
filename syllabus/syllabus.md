# Backend Fundamentals with AI — Syllabus

Course Length: 14 weeks (1 x 120min session/week)  
Delivery: Live instruction with hands-on labs and projects  
Prerequisites: None (beginner-friendly)

## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamentals of backend development using modern tools and practices. Students learn to build RESTful APIs with NestJS, manage databases with PostgreSQL and Prisma, implement authentication, and deploy applications. Throughout the course, AI tools are integrated as learning assistants to help explain concepts, debug code, and accelerate understanding—AI is a helpful partner, not the subject of study.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students can:
- Build RESTful APIs using the NestJS framework
- Design and manage relational databases with PostgreSQL
- Use Prisma ORM for database operations and migrations
- Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Create comprehensive API documentation with Swagger
- Handle errors, validate data, and secure APIs
- Deploy backend applications to production platforms
- Use AI tools effectively as coding assistants and learning partners

## Assessment and Grading

- Participation & Labs: 15%
- Homework: 20%
- Mini Projects (3-4): 40% (10-15% each)
- Final Capstone Project: 25%

Late Policy: 10% per day late, up to 3 days; after 3 days, at instructor discretion.  
Academic Integrity: Attribution required; collaborate on ideas, submit your own work. Use AI tools to learn and understand, not to complete assignments without comprehension.

## Required Tools

- Node.js LTS (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (local installation or cloud)
- VS Code (or equivalent) with recommended extensions
- Git + GitHub account
- Postman or Insomnia (for API testing)
- AI tool access (ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot)

## Topics Overview

- **Weeks 1–2:** Backend foundations, HTTP basics, NestJS setup, database introduction
- **Weeks 3–4:** Database operations with Prisma, CRUD APIs, relationships
- **Weeks 5–6:** Authentication and authorization (JWT, password hashing, role-based access)
- **Weeks 7–8:** API design, validation, error handling, Swagger documentation
- **Weeks 9–10:** Middleware, file handling, external API integration
- **Weeks 11–12:** Environment configuration, security best practices
- **Weeks 13–14:** Deployment basics, capstone project development and presentation

## Projects

- **Mini Project 1:** Simple REST API (CRUD operations)
- **Mini Project 2:** Authentication-enabled API
- **Mini Project 3:** API with documentation and validation
- **Final Capstone Project:** Complete backend application with all features

## AI Integration Approach

AI tools are woven throughout the course as learning assistants:
- **Concept Explanation:** AI helps explain complex topics with analogies and examples
- **Code Generation:** AI generates boilerplate code that students then understand and modify
- **Debugging Support:** AI helps explain errors and suggests fixes
- **Code Review:** AI suggests improvements and refactoring opportunities
- **Documentation:** AI helps generate API documentation and comments

**Note:** AI is a tool to support learning backend development. The focus remains on understanding backend concepts, not on AI prompt engineering.

## Policies and Accessibility

- All materials strive for clarity and beginner-friendliness
- Code examples include comments and explanations
- Students may request reasonable accommodations through the instructor
- Collaborative learning is encouraged; use AI and peers to learn, but submit your own work

## Communication

- Primary: GitHub issues/discussions
- Office hours: 1 hour/week (instructor to announce)
- Response time: ≤48 hours on weekdays
