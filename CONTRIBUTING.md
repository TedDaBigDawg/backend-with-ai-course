- Test all code examples before submitting.

## Local Development

1. Clone this repo

## AI Integration Guidelines

- When suggesting AI usage, focus on learning and understanding, not just copying code.
- Examples should show how to use AI to explain concepts, debug, and learn.
- Avoid making AI the main subject—it's a tool to support backend learning.
